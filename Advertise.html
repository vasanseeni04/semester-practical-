 <name> ARNICA HERBAL OIL </name>
 <about> Herbal oils, also known as oil extracts,are obtained from herbs 
and plant sources; they possess therapeutic benefits. It is well known that 
synergistically a combination of nutrients, bioactive components, antioxidants and 
biostimulants proved to be more effective.Arnica has anti-inflammatory and 
antibacterial properties. Some research has confirmed that arnica can lower pain 
caused by inflammation and decrease the healing time for inflamed bruising on 
your skin.Since arnica oil can reduce inflammation, while at the same time clearing 
away built-up oils and killing bacteria on the scalp, many believe it can help treat 
hair and scalp conditions.</about>
